Agent-Server Knowledge Graph

This is the repository for the ASKG, a project of OAKS, the Open-source Agentic AI Knowledge Stack.

OAKS is a collaboratory, comprised of a set of OSS AI partners and their projects that can be integrated with one another, forming a stack for writing AI applications.

OAKS is maintained as a Notion workspace at 

oaks.town

The ASKG project aims to maintain a knowledge graph of MCP servers and A2A agents that could be used both by himans and AI developer tools to write composable workflows.

We aim to automate the ingestion of MCP server definitions and make the knowledge graph publicly available.  Neo4j provides an instance of AuraDB, a cloud Neo4j database, to host, visualize, and analyze the graph.
